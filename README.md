# MattsRecords

This is the seconds attempt at creating a site that will be the home for my record collection.
I'd started by following a Youtube channel to create an asp dotnet core app with razor pages but soon found out that the code wasn't very well put together and wasn't achieving what we wanted.

Spending some time with Sam, we built a more professional looking project encompassing the same functionality but this time it actually works.
We're able to add artists/albums/compilations/singles etc.
SQL connection strings are now in appsettings.json.
